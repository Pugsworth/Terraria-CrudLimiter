# Terraria-CrudLimiter
Limits the amount of crud you pick up to 1 stack or optionally, a custom amount per item.


This repo currently is still kind of a testing bucket. There are features that don't belong unless I rescope the mod.
I'll most likely be separating those out before I clean up the entire repo (rename, etc).
